To run this test babble, you will need a "database" of patients.
This can be created from an HL7 dump

babble -b file-to-file hl7 ../../../messages.hl7 yaml mymessages.yaml

then using the main function from the query hook:

java -cp ../build/libs/babble-auslab-all-1.3.5.jar org.petermac.babble.auslab.QueryHook mymessages.yaml testdb.yaml

The queries are taken from the Iguana log, excluding the heartbeat
messages (these could be left in but would slow the test).

A direct test can be run using direct-config.yaml file.

A more complete test can be run by running two babble instances,
and using an Iguana server.

The first instance is a fake auslab server for answering the queries,
and can be run using the viaiguana-config-auslab.yaml file.

Then an Iguana channel should be established with that server as
it's destination, and an LLP Listener configured as its source.

Then a second babble instance should be run to send messages to the
Iguana server and retrieve the results from the log.

To make it run successfully, some IP addresses, ports, and passwords
will need to be set. For obvious reasons, these are not included
in the repository.
